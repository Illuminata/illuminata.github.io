        Millions of people browse the web using screen-readers because they can not see (or not well enough). Images without textual descriptions are inaccessible to them, and this is why we should make the effort to provide image descriptions for them.<br><br>Consult the faircamp README for how to add image descriptions, it's simple and an act of kindness.<br><br>Here are some tips for writing good image descriptions:<br>- Any description is better than having no description, don't worry about doing it wrong.<br>- Make it concise. Write as much as needed, but at the same time keep it as short as possible.<br>- Don't interpret. Describe what is there and relevant for its understanding, don't analyze beyond that.<br>- You can use colors where it makes sense - many people only lost their sight later on and understand and appreciate colors.
